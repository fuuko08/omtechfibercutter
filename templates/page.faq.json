Materials, how does it cut)","text":"<p>A fiber cutter is an industrial machine used to process and manipulate metallic materials, in other words, metal fabrication. It is not meant for engraving or marking metals, though you can do simple stuff such as serial number or barcode engravings. Intricate pattern engraving is not what a fiber cutting machine is meant for. It is not recommended for cutting organic\/ acrylic\/ plastic\/ glass materials.<\/p>"}},"faq-2":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"What industries are fiber cutter commonly used for?","text":"<p>Aerospace manufacturing, automotive parts, construction, furniture manufacturing, art sculptures\/installations <\/p>"}},"faq-4":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"What is the lead time from order date to installation?","text":"<p>60-90 days. From the starting point of getting your customized machine built, shipping logistics, to the machine's QC process here at Anaheim, California . We make sure that everything is perfect before it is shipped to you. We will then schedule a machine installation and training date, including electrician setups and a fork-lift rental. <\/p>"}},"0d1ae7bc-c1a3-4d10-b095-a43aff79dd71":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Where are the machines manufactured?","text":"<p>The fiber cutter machines are manufactured overseas with highest quality of parts sourced from all over the world. We perform thorough quality control checks and distribute our machines out of our factory located at Anaheim, California. <\/p>"}},"251338f8-1bd6-4f59-84b1-6a24ff3a6ba6":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"What are the differences between Raycus and IPG laser heads?","text":"<p>IPG laser is a US-based photonics company with a 2-warranty attached to it. They have their own technical support team, and are highly recommended for mass production and precise manufacturing. On the other hand, Raycus is an overseas laser head brand with a dial based fiber source and an economical power usage model. It is great for prototype manufacturing and it requires slightly more power to be comparable with IPG laser sources.<\/p>"}},"f6725cb8-8f17-44b3-990f-82cf2813117e":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Do I need a cover or enclosed machine model?","text":"<p>We'd highly recommend it if your fiber machine is performing at 3kw or higher. We also recommend having a covered model if you have a busy workshop with a continuous workflow or have flammable materials laying around the machine. <\/p>"}},"79062523-832b-4947-9439-573eed69c3ab":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Will weather conditions effect my machine?","text":"<p>If your machine is operating in colder weather, you would need an antifreeze coolant to keep the laser flow constant, otherwise it will cause issues within the laser optical system. If you are operating in a very hot environment, we would recommend having AC within your workshop to prevent machine from overheating. Furthermore, you will need to switch on your industrial water chiller and wait for it to get to an optimal temperature of 22-23 degrees celcius before switching on your laser source. If your machine is operating in humid weather, moisture may effect the laser powersource, and it can cause the machine to shut-down.<\/p>"}},"d683d708-b9df-42d0-9ffb-3b5a918eafb2":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"How do I maintain my industrial laser machine?","text":"<p>First of all, make sure the laser optics are clean to maintain precise cutting. Maintain properly deionized water (chiller system) and airfiltration system every 3 months. Check on the electrical cabinet every 6 months, dust off any unwanted debris, check on the transformers and tighten the connectivity to make sure machine runs properly. <\/p>"}},"6d12fccd-7b2c-46eb-8a48-192062f00db4":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"How do I finance my laser machine?","text":"<p>We have partnered with First Citizen Bank to provide machine financing options of up to 7 years (84 months). For more information, please have a look at our machine financing page. <\/p>"}}},"block_order":["faq-1","faq-2","faq-4","0d1ae7bc-c1a3-4d10-b095-a43aff79dd71","251338f8-1bd6-4f59-84b1-6a24ff3a6ba6","f6725cb8-8f17-44b3-990f-82cf2813117e","79062523-832b-4947-9439-573eed69c3ab","d683d708-b9df-42d0-9ffb-3b5a918eafb2","6d12fccd-7b2c-46eb-8a48-192062f00db4"],"custom_css":["header__title.h2 {margin:40px 0px;}"],"settings":{"title":"Frequently Asked Questions","heading_size":"h2","heading_position":"left"}}},"order":["main","faq"]}
